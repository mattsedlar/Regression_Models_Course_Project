## Executive Summary

## Exploratory Analysis

I started by looking at simple box plot of miles per gallon by automatic and manual transmission types. As figure 1 shows, the interquartile range for automatic transmissions is below the interquartile range of manual transmissions. There certainly appears to be a relationship better mpg and manual transmissions.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)

# calling up and cloning data set for analysis
# converting am variable to factor
data(mtcars)
analysis <- mtcars
analysis$am <- sapply(analysis$am, function(x) ifelse(x==0, "automatic","manual"))

p <- ggplot(analysis) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=am,y=mpg)) +
  xlab("Transmission Type") +
  ylab("Miles per Gallon (U.S.)") +
  ggtitle("Miles per Gallon by Transmission Type")
p

```
